# This is a small python script that can generate the Koch Triangles also known as Snowflakes and save them to svg.

Below are some examples generated by the script:

![A snowflake](Snowflake.png)
![An inverted snowflake](Inverted_Snowflake.png)


And guess what? The mitsubishi logo is just an inverted Koch Triangle with 1 iteration step only
